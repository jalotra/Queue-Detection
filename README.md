# Queue-Detection

## Current Tasks 
1. To use the YOLO Algorithm to detect all the bounding boxes that are persons. 
2. Maybe Fine Tune the Model to only output bounding boxes around humans. Something like this : https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5283660/AI-Queue-Length-Detection-Counting-the-Number-of-P
