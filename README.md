# Queue-Detection

## Current Tasks 
1. To use the YOLO Algorithm to detect all the bounding boxes that are persons. 
2. Maybe Fine Tune the Model to only output bounding boxes around humans. Something like this : https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5283660/AI-Queue-Length-Detection-Counting-the-Number-of-P


## Setting Up the Development Arena 
1. You must have Conda installed, since it provides containerisation we dont have to worry about building and running on Different Platforms/ OSes.
2. First run "bash setup_env.sh" -> This will create a `Queue_Detection` conda environment.
3. Run `conda activate Queue_Detection` to activate the newly made env.
2. Next run "bash setup.sh" -> This will install all the related dependencies.
2. In case of error, read the *sh files and figure it out yourself.
